Gabe clarifies that some Atheists think churches are a way to control people, which shocks me; I had previously entertained the thought that the Gospel was like Santa, something used by parents to make their children obedient.</p><p>Gabe asks how I can know that Mormonism is true but the rest of the religions aren't. I tell him the Joseph Smith story (prayer). Later that week/night, I realized that I had never prayed myself and that I was just trusting my parents and Joseph Smith.</p><p><details><table class=\"chat\"><summary>Gabe asks how I can know that Mormonism is true but the rest of the religions aren't.</summary>\n<tr><td>Me</td><td><div><p>A theist believes that Goes does exist and that you can believe so without being crazy (i.e. while they can intersect, theisism != agnostic-ism). (I'm starting to speak from personal experience and the POV of a theist now:) This evidence is not obvious enough to believe in God without having \"faith\", which means that atheists are <i>not crazy</i> for not believing in God (as opposed to athiests believing that theists <i>are crazy</i>). Keep in mind that just because God does not give us \"signs\" to prove that He exists, it doesn't mean the He does not exist (this is related to something called the Modal Fallacy, btw)</p><p>[...]</p></div></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Gabe</td><td><div><p>I often wonder how one religion believes it is the mst correct when there are countless others</p></div></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Me</td><td><div><p>Ah, yes. That's an <i>extremely good question</i>.</p><p>The general idea is that one <i>must</i> be correct, because if they're all wrong then something would need to be done.</p><p>I'm trying to speak in general, but your question is the very basis for the religion that I follow. I'm fine if you'd rather stick to speaking generally, but I could also speak specifically if you'd like.</p><p>So I guess what I'm asking is: do you want a general answer or what I believe (which isn't \"dur, mine better\")?</p></div></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Gabe</td><td><div><p>specific please</p></div></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Me</td><td><div><p>So, as you may know, I'm a Mormon.</p><p>Our religion was started via a man named Joseph Smith in the 1800s. As a boy (~12 yrs old), he lived in New York. There was a street intersection where on each corner there was a church that said that they were right and the rest were wrong (this place along with the 4 churches still exist, btw).</p><p>Joseph Smith, with the exact same question, read the James 1:5, which states \"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.\"</p><p>Joseph Smith went out to the woods to pray only to learn that all of the religious he was considering were incorrect (lol, he did not see that coming).</p><p>Joseph Smith, with the <i>direct</i> guidance of God (according to our belief), created a new church, in fact restoring The Church of Christ (as in, the churches created by Christ Himself). This is why we're called The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.</p><p>We believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God who renewed the chain of prophets on earth that we hear about in the bible.</p><p>tl;dr yeah, our prophet had the same question</p><p>:stuck_out_tongue:. I believe that you if you look for answer through prayer, wanting an answer (as opposed to having a predisposition that God won't answer/doesn't exist), you'll receive an answer.</p><p>sry to get all preach-y on you :stuck_out_tongue:</p></div></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Gabe</td><td><div><p>What would life on other planets mean to you?</p><p>Would that shake the whole created in their image belief?</p></div></td></tr>\n<tr><td>Me</td><td><div><p>It's kinda like the big bang theory: what if that's just how God created us? I mean, he must have done it somehow (and the Bible speaks of days, which would not be specific length of time before the earth existed, and it never says they were 24 hr periods of time)</p></div></td></tr></table></details></p></div></div><div><h2>2017-11-16</h2><div><p></p><p></p></div></div><div><h2>2017-11-16</h2><div><p></p><p></p></div></div><div><h2>2020-01-29</h2><div><p>We are buying a house!!!</p></div></div><div><h2>2020-02-01</h2><div><p>My Harvard interview went great!
